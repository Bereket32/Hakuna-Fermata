lyrics:

haha

So you Wanna learn about Priority Queues?

Look, I'll be creative 
I'm not a rapper but I'll go and rap out all ya basics 
Would call it lessons (but) my profession ain't really my major
but my priority  is get you queued in all your basics 

I ran my race, and came in first 
my haters need to face it 
I'm first one in and last one out 
and that's really the basics 

Binary Heap or Tree
it's not hard to go and make it
you can use a linked list too 
its up to you
just be persuasive 

And don't forget the Runtimes 
but it's kind algebraic 
Remember it's different for different actions
how you make it

FOr most ya actions look Binary Heaps's the best 
replay it 
To Insert and Remove its O(logn) 
no need to say it 

Binary Heap's the same
I hate to have to go and break it
Linked list slower 
but I know its hard to go and face it 

I'm done for now remember just replay it 
It's easier than you think 
no need to go 
and try translate it 

Priority Queues
